# **Mushroom Classification**
Hello and welcome to my mushroom classification project. This was my final project for the Data Science Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs.

## **Overview**
I have been fascinated by our little fungal friends for years. The sheer diversity and reproductive strategies is simply amazing, some mushrooms have 20 000+ mating types! I explored this subject on two levels: 
-A binary identification of morels and false morels 
-Attempting to a model to identify all species I could find labeled images of that had at least 100 photos of.
